Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It was designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible while encouraging clean and pragmatic design.

Here are some key features of Django:

MTV Architecture: Django follows the Model-Template-View (MTV) architectural pattern.

Model: Represents the data structure (database tables) and handles the database.
Template: Handles the presentation layer (HTML, CSS, etc.).
View: Controls the logic and responds to user requests by passing data between the Model and Template.
ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): Django comes with a powerful ORM that allows you to interact with your database using Python code instead of raw SQL. This means you can perform database queries and manage database tables directly in Python.

Admin Interface: Django automatically generates an administrative interface (admin panel) for managing site content. This is a major productivity booster as it allows easy content management without custom coding.

Security: Django comes with built-in protection against many security threats, including cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), SQL injection, and clickjacking.

Scalability: Django is designed to help developers build large-scale web applications with features like caching, middleware, and easy integration with databases and web servers.

Templating System: It has a flexible templating engine that separates the logic from the presentation layer, making it easy to create dynamic HTML pages.

Batteries-Included: Django includes many built-in features and packages like user authentication, URL routing, sessions, and much more, reducing the need to rely on third-party libraries.

Community and Documentation: Django has a large, active community and extensive documentation, making it easier for developers to find support, solutions, and best practices.
